/***************************************** 1.1 — Github in visual studio 2022 ******************************************************************
*	We can automatically save our code to github by using the integrated to VS git. First, press the window "git" just above, and choose
*	the option "Créer un débot Git". Then, go again to the window "git", and choose the option "push", to save your project in github,
*	because when you create a repository, it's firstly created loacaly on your computer. You should also use the option "Commit of 
*	stash", because you can add a message which will explain your commitment. When you'll press the button "valider tout", be sure to 
*	choose the option "enregistrer et valider", because to push some changes, you must first save them in your file.
*  
*  Also, you can write your code directly in github, if you switch to the mode editor! If you do that, commit your changes in github, 
*  and then in visual studio, press the arrow "pull", or "tirer" in French, to recover the changes in your file.
* 
*	Now, let's talk about the operation "fetch", "récuperer". This operation is mostly usefull when you work in a team. Imagine your 
*	friend had commited some changes from github, and before pull it, you would first like to look to the changes. In this case, use t
*	the operation "fetch".
